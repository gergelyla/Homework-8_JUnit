# Homework-8_JUnit

Write a calculator that is capable of computing a metric distance value from an expression that contains different scales and systems.

Output should be specified by the user.

Only Addition and subtraction is allowed.

Implement the calculator and write unit tests that prove that the computations are correct.

Supported formats: mm, cm, dm, m, km



Examples:



Output is in lowest unit.

Expression: 10 cm + 1 m - 10 mm 

Result: 1090 mm

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the previous implemented calculator, make sure you have the following tests:

- one parameterized test

- one suite of tests which contains all existing ones

Create a statistics repository where each computing time will be hold. Add extra methods for analysing data and create unit tests for the
repo using TDD.
